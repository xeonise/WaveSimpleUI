A simple ui for wave, that I vibecoded, since I don't like the default one, how to use it:
First, you have to login to your account(the account MUST have a active subscription) in the Wave launcher, otherwise it won't work.
Than, you have to download/build the injector for the UI:

1. build it from the source (if you don't trust me)
you can build it yourself, by downloading golang(https://go.dev/dl/)
and than, in the directory typing:
go build, after that, you can launch Wave.exe, after you launch the Wave.exe, go to the website http://localhost:61416/ui
2. download it from releases
https://github.com/xeonise/WaveSimpleUI/releases, extract the zip file, containing both ui.html and Wave.exe into the same folder.

Run Wave.exe, after running it, you can go to http://localhost:61416/ui, and you will be able to execute scripts once it injects.

Btw, if you want wave to inject fast, than run the Wave.exe before launching roblox.

Here's how the UI looks like:
